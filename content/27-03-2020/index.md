# Berlin Mitte to Potsdam via Kladow along the west bank of Havel

In Berlin we are lucky that during the Corona quarantine we are allowed to do
exercise and cycling is therefore allowed. People living in the same household
are also allowed to spend time together.

Beautiful slow ride mostly on the bank of Havel. Mostly paved bicycle paths.

First to get out of town from Mitte we cycled west west west, via Charlottenburg
and Westend, passing urban housing projects that once were possible even in “capitalist” West but today are somehow not so easy to find going on.

Then we reached the river, Havel, along which we’ll be riding down south-west to
reach Potsdam. Soon we found a pretty cool unusually looking fields which, as it
turned out in 19th century were used for the biological treatment of waste water
and is now turned into a nature preserve. The place is called “Rieselfeld Karolinenhöhe” and is very recommended for a walk or cycle. There is an
interesting wiki entry in German about the system of waste processing used in
XIX century Berlin – https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Rieselfelder.
We took a break there in the fields, had some sandwiches and I had a beer.

From there on the ride was along the Havel river all the time. Pretty fields,
beautiful villas on the river bank, winding paths between the trees – top
quality riding. On and on, and you reach the very pretty Protestant Church of the Redeemer, situated on the bank of lake Jungfernsee and on the other side you can
also see the beautiful [Glinieker Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Glienicke), part of [Potsdam cultural ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaces_and_Parks_of_Potsdam_and_Berlin).

It is another 10km to reach the city of Potsdam cycling through foresty banks of
Jungfernsee and Krampnitzsee, small lakes formed by Havel.
