# Spree, Havel and Berlin-Spandauer Schifffahrtskanal

This is was an evening ride along the water. We left home after 16:30, the ride
was about 3 hours and most of the ride is over separate cycling lane or walking
paths without many people.

The route starts from Berlin Mitte/Wedding going west to Spandau along the
river Spree: a bunch of bridges and many industrial sights in the first stretch.

The second part starts where Spree and Havel meet and you ride into old/central
Spandau and by Spandau Citadel – an interesting historic site, I like it and take
friends visitign Berlin here. Pretty ride along the newly built embankment.

The third part is a smooth straight ride along the "Berlin-Spandau" ship canal
crossing some cosy tiny bridges on the way and mostly rolling by the "little
garden" communities right along the once fun Tegel airport (you could be sitting
on board of a plane in 35 minutes after leaving your flat in Mitte).

Beautiful route, very recommended.
