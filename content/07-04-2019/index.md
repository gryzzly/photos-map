# Oranienburg Dino Park

A cycle trip up north to Oranienburg.

We started via Wedding and cycled all the way up to Oraniendamm. At the place
where Berliner Strasse comes near Alt-Hermsdorf we noticed
a cute turn between the houses that led onto nice long secluded walking
/cycling next to beautiful marshes. Very nice start!
